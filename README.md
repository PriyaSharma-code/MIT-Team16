TEAM 16

Our team members used 2 approaches: 1)NodeJS with HTML, CSS and Javascript 2)Python and  open source Python library called Streamlit for integration.

In both approaches, we have integrated a front-end page with the cleaned dataset and operations in the back-end.The filtered dataset contains only the stock values for one symbol and various charts were constructed using various APIs on same dataset.

APPROACH 1:

API: chartJS, apexCharts

Technology: HTML,CSS,ExpressJS,NodeJS

APPROACH 2:

Following Program Displays a Financial Dashboard for viewing OHLC charts.

Following charts are displayed on the Dashboard:
1. OHLC
2. CandleStick
3. Vertex Line
4. Colored Bar

Python Libraries Used:
1. Streamlit
2. Pandas
3. Plotly

Data has been retrieved from the API provided and converted into .csv format for ease of access
Data has been organized for 100 stock entries of the top 20 stocks in the file "stockdata.csv" which include :
'AAPL','MSFT','GOOG','GOOGL','ADSK','AMZN','FB','TSLA','TSM','NVDA','V','JPM','JNJ','BABA','WMT','UNH','BAC','MA','PG','HD'
