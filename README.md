# MIT-Team16

TEAM 16

Our team members used 2 approaches:
1)React.js with HTML, CSS and Javascript
2)Python for front-end and back-end

in both approaches, we have integrated a front-end page with the cleaned dataset and operations in the back-end.

We have used python for both front-end and back-end operations. Have taken into use open source Python library called Streamlit for integration.
